Google Cloud Platform (GCP) is a Google-provided set of cloud computing services. It is a platform that offers computing infrastructure and services for running applications, storing and managing data, and developing software solutions.


The cloud technology that used in this project:

-   **Google Cloud Platform**: Suite of cloud computing services provided by Google.
-   **Firestore**: database for application.
-   **App Engine**: For deploying Backend API.
-   **Cloud Storage**: For storing the image assets.
-   **Cloud Run**: For deploying machine learning model.

## Technology Used

There are four applications of Google Cloud technologies in the **Fruitarians** application: Firestore, App Engine, Cloud Storage, and Cloud Run. On the cloud side, these three services are utilized to handle all requests and provide data services.
